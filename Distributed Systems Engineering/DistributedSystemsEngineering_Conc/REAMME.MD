# IMPORTANT
I have written 2 implementations of the Merger.java class. You can test both of them out by commenting out the one already inside the try-catch and removing the comments for the other code. The one currently available is the one that precicely follows the instructions of the project and produces humming numbers that are 1. out of order and 2. duplicates. The other implementation is one that will produce all humming numbers, without skipping a signle one, no duplicates and all in the right order.

# Instructons
To run the code simply compile the Main.java file and then run it to see the results. You will get only 50 humming numbers, however if you want to get even more you can go to the Printer.java file and change the counter limit in the for loop.
